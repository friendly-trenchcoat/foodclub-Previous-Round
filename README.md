# foodclub-Previous-Round
Lists previous round's winners on one page

Note: While it **doesn't do anything worth being called cheating**, its accessing the other pages is ***techinically against the rules***. 
That being said, you have virtually no chance of being frozen, as far as I know. Even if this tiny quantity of page loads is detected, it's on pages where you have nothing to gain except maybe a random event. **Use at your own discression.**

Tripple-click the names to select them all, and this press CTRL+C to copy them. 
Now you can easily paste them into the 'Highlight Winners' box (see script below)
