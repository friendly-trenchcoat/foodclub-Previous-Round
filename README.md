# foodclub-Previous-Round
Lists previous round's winners on one page

Note: While it doesn't do anything worth being called cheating, its accessing the other pages is ***techinically against the rules***. That being said, you have virtually no chance of being frozen, as far as I know.

Tripple-click the names to select them all, and this press CTRL+C to copy them. 
Now you can easily paste them into the 'Highlight Winners' box (see script below)
